# @heptalogos/configuration

## Purpose

configuration owns the current Product ConfigurationDefinition,
ConfigurationRevision, ConfigurationActivation, and effective-value semantics.
The Product composition supplies the current owner definitions; this package
provides the generic bounded managed-revision route consumed by their real
runtime owners.

## Owns

- Composition-provided code-owned definitions and their JSON Schema contracts.
- Immutable PostgreSQL-backed managed revisions.
- Explicit Host-fenced activation CAS and effective-value resolution.
- Configuration metadata and redacted read projections.

## Does not own

- Secret plaintext or OS credential storage.
- Configuration files, watchers, import/export, or a source registry.
- Provider SDK objects, runtime reconciliation, or Management authorization.
- A second persistence or transaction boundary.

The current Product composition registers the NetworkAccess gateway transport,
Subject cognition runtime and Expression budgets, and Product Host HTTP
admission definitions. The service has no gateway-specific validation or
activation lookup.

## Verification

Run the configuration unit tests, typecheck, and the real PostgreSQL Product
Host integration when activation persistence or restart behavior changes.
